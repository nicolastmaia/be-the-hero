# Be The Hero

This is a project developed as an exercise during **Rocketseat's 11th OmniStack Week** using NodeJS, React Native and ReactJS with the guidance of [@diego3g](https://github.com/diego3g). Its purpose is to allow recycling institutions to broadcast their work and for potential clients (people who have something to recycle) to get in contact with them.

The project consists of three folders: **backend**, **web**, and **mobile**.

- The backend part of the project is a NodeJS API server that receives and forwards requests to a MongoDB instance installed on the server machine and then creates responses for client apps (web or mobile);
- The web part is written in reactJS and is where the institutions register themselves;
- The mobile part shows the institutions in your area as pins on a map and allows you to select one to view more information and then open a card with some of its contact information.
